# Street Art Detroit

This WebApp will display a collection of public art in the city of Detroit. You can see the location of all the murals overlayed on a map, or a gallery of images sorted by neighborhood or artist.

Users can log-in to select their favorite art peices and recieve recommendations based on a collaborative filtering algorithm.
Users will also able to "check-in" at different murals, and compete with others to "collect" the most murals, and upload any new murals that are not in our database yet. 

we hope to encourage Detroiters and visitors to explore, enjoy and interact with the hundreds of murals in this city.
